These samples can be replaced (say with other timbers), but the code relies on a certain naming convention.

e.g.

0.A0.wav
1.Bb0.wav
...
39.C4.wav
...
45.Gb.wav

So, 39.C4.wav is middle C.

That is:
0.A0.wav is A0 and the lowest key on an 88 key keyboard.
1.Bb0.wav is Bb0 and the next key up.
39.C4.wav is middle C - it's the 39th key on an 88 key keyboard (zero-based index)
87.C8.wav is the highest C on an 88 keyboard (again, array starts at zero)
