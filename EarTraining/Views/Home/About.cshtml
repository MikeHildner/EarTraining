<p>This site was created to provide additional eartraining drills for my own personal use after I began to study <a href="https://www.harrisonmusic.com"> Mark Harrison</a>'s <a href="https://www.harrisonmusic.com/store/c7/Ear_Training_Books_Audio.html">Contemporary Eartraining series</a> (Published by Hal Leonard).</p>

<p>I thought it would be useful, and a fun programming exercise, to create additional drills that are random and available in any key.</p>

<h3>About the Piano Samples</h3>
<p>The original piano samples were downloaded from a University of Iowa <a href="http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/mispiano.html">site</a>. Many thanks to those who made the samples freely available. On this site, those samples are found <a href="@Url.Content("~/UIOWA_AIFFs")">here</a>.</p>
<p>Since those samples did not have an immediate attack, they were modified using <a href="https://github.com/naudio/NAudio">NAudio</a>, with the results <a href="@Url.Content("~/Samples")">here</a>, these samples are used to generate notes and chords on this stie.</p>
