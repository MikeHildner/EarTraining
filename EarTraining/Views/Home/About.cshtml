<p>This site was created to provide additional eartraining drills for my own personal use after I began to study <a href="https://www.harrisonmusic.com" target="_blank"> Mark Harrison</a>'s <a href="https://www.harrisonmusic.com/store/c7/Ear_Training_Books_Audio.html" target="_blank">Contemporary Eartraining</a> series (Published by Hal Leonard).</p>

<p>I thought it would be useful, and a fun programming exercise, to create additional drills that are random and available in any key.</p>

<h3>About the Piano Samples</h3>
<p>The original piano samples were downloaded from a University of Iowa <a href="http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/mispiano.html" target="_blank">site</a>. Many thanks to those who made the samples freely available.</p>

<hr />

<h3>How the Audio is Generated</h3>
<p>Using the samples described above, <a href="https://github.com/naudio/NAudio" target="_blank">NAudio</a> is used to read the samples, combine / mix if necessary (e.g. for melodies / chords), then save to .mp3 files. The resulting .mp3 files are what gets played.</p>
