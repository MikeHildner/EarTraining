# EarTraining

This site was created to provide additional eartraining drills for my own personal use after I began to study <a href="https://www.harrisonmusic.com"> Mark Harrison</a>'s Contemporary Eartraining series:

    <a href="https://www.harrisonmusic.com/store/c7/Ear_Training_Books_Audio.html">Contemporary Eartraining</a> Level One. By Mark Harrison, published by Hal Leonard. ISBN 978-0-8256-9392-2
    <a href="https://www.harrisonmusic.com/store/c7/Ear_Training_Books_Audio.html">Contemporary Eartraining</a> Level Two. By Mark Harrison, published by Hal Leonard. ISBN 978-0-8256-9393-9

I thought it would be useful, and a fun programming exercise, to create additional drills that are random and available in any key.
