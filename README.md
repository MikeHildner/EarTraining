# EarTraining

This site was created to provide additional eartraining drills for my own personal use after I began to study <a href="https://www.harrisonmusic.com"> Mark Harrison</a>'s Contemporary Eartraining series.

I thought it would be useful, and a fun programming exercise, to create additional drills that are random and available in any key.
